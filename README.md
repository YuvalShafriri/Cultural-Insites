Cultural‑Insites — CBSA assistant workspace

Purpose

This repository contains the core instruction set and workspace for an automated assistant supporting CBSA (Context‑Based Significance Assessment) of built heritage. It stores the binding system prompt, workflow steps, and taxonomies used to run reproducible Stage 0–6 assessments.

Root files

- `Steps.md` — CBSA workflow and mandatory stage templates (Stages 0–6).
- `SystemPrompt.md` — Workshop system prompt: persona, rules, and chaining requirements.
- `Appendices.md` — Taxonomies (values, contexts), KG recipe, and helper guidance.

Notes

- This branch (`main`) holds the core instruction files; larger data directories are intentionally kept out of version control and stored externally.
- Use the provided workflow and templates to run assessments and generate artifacts; open issues or PRs to propose changes.
