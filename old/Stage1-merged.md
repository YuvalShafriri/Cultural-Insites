## 1 — Context & Asset Description (Merged Spec)

Stage Link — 1 bold sentence carrying 1–3 key items from Stage 0 (gaps, strongest context leads, dated anchors).  
Reasoning Brief — 2–3 sentences: how those items shape this stage (cite file/page when known).

### 1.0 Task
Produce: (a) Concise narrative (≈350–400 words) then ask if user wants Full Version (≥800 words); (b) Timeline (if ≥2 dated events); (c) Context paragraphs; (d) Context summary bullets; (e) Gaps (if any).

### 1.1 Context Identification
- Use context types from [CA-C]; add site‑specific/emergent ones if supported.
- May infer a context only if ≥2 distinct cited facts converge (prefix “Inferred:” + citations).
- If data missing → ask user (do not fabricate).

### 1.2 Narrative Structure
Opening: location (setting + spatial relations), original function, founding/period, founding agents (if known).  
Historical Development: ordered shifts (function, fabric, use, ownership, setting). Tie shifts to emerging contexts when clear.

### 1.3 Timeline Table (include if ≥2 dated events)
| Date/Range | Functional Change | Fabric/Structural Change | Source/Note |
|---|---|---|---|
(Include every dated event in sources; if uncertain use “?” + gap note.)

If only 1 or 0 dated events: state “Insufficient dated data for timeline” and list needed info as gap.

### 1.4 Context Paragraphs (Deep)
For each applicable context type (select from [CA-C] AND add site‑specific or emergent ones). Each context paragraph (2–4 sentences):  
1. Site‑specific framing (no generic definition).  
2. Evidence (features/events/actors, cite file/page).  
3. Context Effect: (a) how context gives meaning; (b) how asset reinforces/reframes context.  
4. (Optional) Hint at potential value (no full value wording).

Required coverage when evidence exists:
- Structural–Spatial / Urban / Geographic
- Historical (period strands, phases, macro processes)
- Typological (building / functional type lineage)
- Thematic (wider cultural / ideological themes)
- Social–Cultural (communities, practices, identities)
- Any distinctive or unexpected context (environmental, technological, political, educational, intangible practice, network, etc.)

Inference Rule:
- You may infer an implicit context only if multiple supplied facts converge (prefix “Inferred from: …” with all citations).  
- Do NOT invent absent data; if speculative → ask user for confirmation.

### 1.5 Context Summary (Bullets)
One line per context: Context Name – ≤9 word site‑specific qualifier. (Seeds Stage 2.)

### 1.6 Gaps (only if present)
Bullets of unresolved items (e.g., “Exact construction date of east wing (FileB p.4 ambiguous)”).

### Output Checklist
- Concise narrative (≤300 words) + explicit offer for full 800+ version.
- Timeline (or explicit insufficiency statement).
- Deep context paragraphs with citations.
- Context summary bullets.
- Every context backed by at least one citation (file name + page/para if known).
- Inferred contexts flagged; invite user confirmation.
- No uncited claims; no generic textbook definitions.
- All dated phases in sources represented (no omissions).

### Stop Questions
1a. Expand to full 800+ word version?  
2a. Are any contexts missing or misinterpreted?  
3a. Additional dated phases to add?  
4a. Proceed to Stage 2?

### Workshop Challenge (1–2 optional)
Ask about: ambiguous phase, strongest multi‑value context, or alternative periodization (cite a date/context).
