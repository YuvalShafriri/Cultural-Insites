## 1 — Context & Asset Description
**Stage Link** — **Bold one clear sentence at the start** summarizing the carry-over from Stage 0. Name 1–3 key items when possible, more or fewer if justified (e.g., key gaps, timeline entries, context types). Keep it concise but detailed enough to anchor this stage’s reasoning.
- Reasoning Brief — 2–3 sentences explaining how these items informed this stage’s output, citing filename/page when known.

**Coverage (include as relevant):**
| Topic | Mandatory details |
|---|---|
| Location & Setting | Country/region, landscape, visual relations |
| Original Function & Date | Year built, creators, purpose |
| Evolution | Functional/structural changes by period |
| Contexts | Select from [CA-C] Context Types. Consider both how the context contributes value to the asset and how the asset elevates the context’s significance (“context effect”). |
| Physical Description | Typology, plan, materials, architect (if known) |
| Finds & Artefacts | Significant discoveries |

**Timeline Table (mandatory if Stage 0 found enough detail)**
| Date/Range | Functional change | Structural change | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|

**Output Checklist**
- Narrative ≤300 words (offer full version on request).
- Timeline table (if sufficient detail).
- Bullet list of contexts (labels from [CA‑C]).
- In‑text citations to user files.
- Notes:
  - Appendix lists aren’t exhaustive; include unique, site‑specific contexts supported by user files.
  - If a “Timeline/Development Phases” section exists in the files, include all items—do not omit.
  - Every context must be evidence‑backed (fabric/docs/oral, etc.; cite filename + page/para when known). You may infer implicit context from user materials, but do not invent it.
