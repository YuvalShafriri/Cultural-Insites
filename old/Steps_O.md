# CBSA – Steps (0–6)

Appendix policy: Apply [GB] always. When a stage lists an [SM‑#] item, it is required for that stage. [CA] items are consulted only when helpful; do not copy inline.

<!-- ## 0 — Pre‑check & Data‑Gap Scan
**Purpose:** Run an ultra‑light health‑check before Stage 1.
**Output:**
- Summary of uploaded material (≤120 words): scope, periods, asset type(s).
- 
- Gaps/ambiguities that block reliable assessment (bullets).
- Data suggestions (2–4): exactly what to add/obtain and how (photos, plans, citations, stakeholder input).

**Checklist**
| Category | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Location & Setting |  |  |
| Original Function & Dates |  |  |
| Evolution / Phases |  |  |
| Contexts (social, historical, etc.) |  |  |
| Physical Description |  |  |
| Finds / Artefacts |  |  |

**Stop Questions**
1. Would you like to add, correct, or change anything in this summary?
2. Do you approve moving to Stage 1?

**Workshop Challenge Questions**
Generate 1–2 targeted questions about data‑gathering priorities or source reliability, based on the actual gaps found. (See [GB‑1] for HIL rules.) -->

## 1 — Context & Asset Description
**Stage Link** — **Bold one clear sentence at the start** summarizing the carry-over from Stage 0. Name 1–3 key items when possible, more or fewer if justified (e.g., key gaps, timeline entries, context types). Keep it concise but detailed enough to anchor this stage’s reasoning.



- Reasoning Brief — 2–3 sentences explaining how these items informed this stage’s output, citing filename/page when known.

**Coverage (include as relevant):**
| Topic | Mandatory details |
|---|---|
| Location & Setting | Country/region, landscape, visual relations |
| Original Function & Date | Year built, creators, purpose |
| Evolution | Functional/structural changes by period |
| Contexts | Select from [CA‑C] Context Types |
| Physical Description | Typology, plan, materials, architect (if known) |
| Finds & Artefacts | Significant discoveries |

**Timeline Table (mandatory if Stage 0 found enough detail)**
| Date/Range | Functional change | Structural change | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|

**Output Checklist**
- Concise narrative (≤300 words) + offer full version on request.
- Completed timeline table if useful.
- Bullet list of contexts (labels from [CA‑C]).
- In‑text citations to user files.
- Notes:
• Appendix lists are not exhaustive; include unique, site‑specific contexts supported by user files.
• If a “Timeline/Development Phases” section exists in the files, include all items—do not omit.
• Every context must be evidence‑backed (fabric/docs/oral, etc; cite filename + page/para when known).   You may infer implicit context from user materials, but do not invent it.


**Stop Questions**
1. Would you like to add, correct, or change anything in this summary?
2. Do you approve moving to Stage 2 (Value Analysis)?

**Workshop Challenge Questions**
Generate 1–2 questions on context interpretation alternatives or periodization decisions rooted in the user’s materials.
Reference at least one specific element from this stage (e.g., named attribute, timeline year, else).
---

## 2 — Value Analysis
- Stage Link — one sentence summarizing the updated conclusion from the previous stage(s), naming 1–3 concrete items  (e.g., specific context items, timeline entries, asset descriptors, physical description).
- Reasoning Brief — 2–3 sentences explaining how these items informed this stage’s output, citing filename/page when known.

### Identify Values
- Use value types in [CA-V] (e.g.,  Aesthetic, Historical, Social, Scientific, Spiritual, etc.).
- Also scan for context or value types unique to the site that are not listed in [CA-V], and note them explicitly when supported by the user’s materials.

**2.0 Values — short numbered bullets**  
Use value types in [CA-V] (Aesthetic, Historical, Social, etc.).
Write **4–6 bullets** (target 90–150 words; may extend to 200–240 when evidence requires) that **name each value** (Historical, Aesthetic, Social, Technological, Symbolic/Landscape, etc.) and state **what it means at this site** in **1–2 sentences**. Use plain words; define unfamiliar terms in ≤10 words. If >6 values, list top 5–6 then add “Additional values (brief): …” with names + ≤5‑word meanings. The **full set** appears in the table.

**2.1 Unified Values–Attributes–Meaning–Consequence Table**  
*A single map from Attribute → Value(s) → Meaning → Consequence for Significance.*

| Attribute | Associated value(s) | Site‑specific meaning (≤9 words) | Consequence for Significance |
|---|---|---|---|

Guidance: one row per attribute; order rows by significance (high→low). Keep meanings as short phrases. If a change type adds clarity, prefix inside the last column: **(Fabric)**, **(Use)**, **(Setting)**, **(Infrastructure)**, **(Interpretation)**.  
References: value types → [CA‑V]; change‑type lexicon → [CA‑T].

**Quality checks**
- Every value named in §2.0 (including any “Additional values”) appears at least once in the table.
- Each row names value(s), gives a ≤9‑word meaning, and states a clear consequence in plain words.
• Include site-specific values even if not in [CA-V], when supported by the user’s inferred material.
• Maintain source certainty; note uncertainties.


**Stop Questions**
1. Does this value analysis read correctly? What would you change?
2. Proceed to Stage 3?

**Workshop Challenge Questions**
Generate 1–2 questions on value tensions, prioritization, or smallest‑harm adaptations grounded in the user’s content.
Reference at least one specific element from this stage (e.g., named attribute, values, value sensitivity, community values, etc).
examples: 
w1. Which of these values, if lost, would most alter the site’s significance?
w2. Are there community or local values missing from the table?
 
---

## 3 — Integrity & Authenticity (Nara Grid)
- Stage Link — one sentence summarizing the updated conclusion from the previous stage(s), naming 1–3 concrete items (e.g., “Timeline 1923”; “Value: Historical—RC frame”...).
- Reasoning Brief — 2–3 sentences explaining how these items informed this stage’s output.
- Note: if the integrity assessment is not accurate, explain why.

**Output**
- **Integrity Assessment**
- **Nara Grid**

**Template**
| Aspect | Description | Value Expression | Condition |
|---|---|---|---|

**Assess**
- Compare current vs. original; cite specific attributes.
- Explain how condition changes affect value expression (use Stage‑2 values to anchor).
- Note features enhancing/diminishing authenticity.

**Regional Note (optional)**
If the content indicates a specific national/regional framework, offer to review through that lens. (See [SM‑3].)
"ℹ️ Regional Note: Different heritage frameworks may prioritize authenticity differently here. Would you like to explore how [detected region] approaches this?"

**Stop Questions**
- Is the integrity assessment accurate? Describe any changes.
- Any preservation data to add before Stage 4?

**Workshop Challenge Questions**
Generate 1–2 questions on authenticity dilemmas or condition priorities 
(e.g., restoration vs. conservation; materials vs. techniques; setting vs. fabric).
Reference at least one specific element from this stage .
**Required:** [SM‑3] Integrity & Nara Grid Guidance and summary.

---

## 4 — Comparative Evaluation
- Stage Link — one sentence summarizing the updated conclusion from the previous stage(s), naming 1–3 concrete items  (e.g., “Nara grid items, Values attributes etc”; “Value: Historical—RC frame”;...).
- Reasoning Brief — 2–3 sentences explaining how these items informed this stage’s output, citing filename/page when known.

 **Tasks**
- Identify ≥2 comparable sites (geographic/typologic/thematic).
- State criteria using [CA‑CS]: Period, Rarity, Documentation, Connection to Ensemble, Condition, Selectivity/Diversity, Research Potential (pick the 2–4 most relevant and justify).
- Short synthesis: what is distinctive here vs. the comparison set.

**Stop Questions**
1 Do you have more comparanda or points to add?  
2 Proceed to Stage 5?

**Workshop Challenge Questions**
Generate 1–2 questions on comparative blind spots or uniqueness vs. representativeness based on the user’s materials.

Reference (phrasing aids): [CA‑E].

## 5 — Cultural‑Significance Statement
- Cross-reference: explicitly cite the prior all stages elements used (e.g., “Timeline 1923”; “Value: Historical—RC frame”; “Nara: Setting row”).
- Stage Link — one sentence summarizing the updated conclusion from the previous all stage(s)  explicitly cite the prior all stages elements as the base for the statement
- Reasoning Brief — 2–3 sentences explaining how these items informed this stage’s output, citing filename/page when known.

**Output (3–5 paragraphs, ≤300 words initial):**
- Mandatory synthesis: the opening paragraph must explicitly cite the important elements from each of Stages 1–4 (context/timeline; values table; Nara grid; comparatives) and show how they cohere.
- Evidence rule: link claims to user files or prior confirmed excerpts; no external sources.
 
- Begin with a 2–3 sentence excerpt that sets tone and shape.
- Synthesize context, values, integrity, and comparatives into a coherent statement of significance.
- Offer Knowledge‑Graph option (see [CA‑KG]); generate only if the user asks.
- Offer (optional, only if requested): a brief semiotic reading (symbols, metaphors, cultural codes) derived from the site’s values and contexts.
- Offer (optional, only if requested): ideas for educational/community/tourism uses grounded in the values.


**Stop Questions**
1. Does this statement reflect the asset’s essence?
2. Add keywords? Generate KG?
3. Would you like a semiotic reading of the overall process? (Offer; perform only if requested.)
4. Add educational/community/tourism use ideas?



**Workshop Challenge Questions**
Generate 1–2 questions on narrative coherence, audience/voice, or scale (local ↔ universal) grounded in the user’s materials.

Reference (phrasing aids): [CA‑E].

## 6 — Pulse Check (Audit & Credibility Review)
**Purpose:** supportive end‑of‑process health check.

**Output**
1. **👍 What’s strong** — two or three upbeat sentences.
2. **🧐 Quick boost** — compact table (≤3 rows):  
   | Topic | Small tweak that would make a difference |  
3. **🚀 Next step** — one or two concise bullets with a concrete action (e.g., add a photo, take a measurement, attach a citation).
Professional Context Enhancement (Optional)
If the content suggests a specific regional/national context, offer:
"🌍 Professional Practice Note: Based on your site's location/context, you might want to consider [specific regional framework]. Would you like me to review your assessment through that lens?"
Options: Yes / No / Tell me more.

**Stop Question**
Would you like to take the quick action suggested (or something else), or move on to finish?

**Workshop Challenge Questions**
Generate 1–2 questions on professional practice (efficiency, communication, collaboration, standards navigation) as revealed by this assessment.

Reference (phrasing aids): [CA‑E].
