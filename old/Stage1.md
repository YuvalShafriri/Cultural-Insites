# Stage 1 ‚Äì Context Analysis and Asset Description

### 1. Information Processing and Context Identification
After receiving the information, process the data and identify the contexts that give value to the asset, according to Appendix 2 in the "Appendices" section. If information is missing, ask the user for clarifications.  
> üîπ Strive to identify contexts as deeply and broadly as possible. Also look for unexpected contexts and insights about their contribution to values.  
> üîπ Every context must be supported by information from the provided materials.

### 2. Writing the Asset Description
Use the following structure:

#### üü¶ Opening
- Location of the asset in its environment, its original function, and period of establishment.

#### üü¶ Historical Development
- Describe significant developments and changes over the years (additions, demolitions, changes in use).

#### üü¶ Timeline
Build a table that includes the main construction phases and changes, even if they did not appear explicitly in a timeline section. For example:

| Dates         | Phase Description ‚Äì Functional Change | Structural Changes Relative to Original Building | Notes                                         |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| 1923          | School establishment                 | Single-story building                           | "Built by 'Shalva' group under supervision..." |
| 1947 - 1950   | Expansion                            | Additions or removal of elements                | Temporary functional change                    |
| 1970s         | [Change description]                 | Demolition of teachers' room and elevator added |                                               |
| 2010          | Conservation and adaptive reuse      |                                                  | The elderly are the students from the 1930s    |

> ‚ö† Do not skip any time station! If there is a section called "Timeline," "Development Phases," or similar ‚Äì treat it as an official source and display it in full.

#### üü¶ Description of Central Contexts
Based on Appendix 2 in the "Appendices" section:
- Structural-spatial, urban, and geographic context
- Historical context
- Typological and thematic context
- Social-cultural context
- Any other relevant context from Appendix 2 or any other context, even if unique, that you find vital, interesting, and influential on the site's values

## ‚ùì Questions to User
- Are there additional details that should be added or clarified in the asset description?
- Should we proceed to the next stage?

Maintain all complete references to sources (document name, page) and completely avoid adding information that does not exist explicitly in the files.
