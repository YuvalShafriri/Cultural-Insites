GitHub Copilot: Stage 0 — Pre-check & Data-Gap Scan (Tabgha / Heptapegon)

Summary of uploaded material (≤120 words)  
Multi‑component sacred Christian pilgrimage landscape on NW shore Sea of Galilee (Seven Springs valley): Benedictine Church of the Multiplication (4th‑c chapel; 5th–6th‑c basilica with famed bread‑and‑fish + Nile‑motif mosaics; 1980 reconstruction), Franciscan Primacy (quarry “steps”, Mensa Christi rock, repeated small chapels), Beatitudes chapel remains on northern slope, springs (Ein Nur), hydraulic features (aqueduct, water‑raising towers, watermills), cultivated valley (olive, fruit, banana), anchorages / stone anchors, quarry, grotto (Eremos/Hillcrest debate), papal visits (1964, 2000), modern monastic/guest uses, long research sequence (surveys 1889–90; excavations 1911, 1930s, 1968–69; reconstruction 1980).

0.1 Gaps / Ambiguities (blocking or limiting precision)  
- Exact dating & function of harbor / anchor stones (undated).  
- Competing locational traditions for Sermon on the Mount (chapel vs. Hillcrest of Eremos).  
- Present condition / authenticity differentials: reconstructed capitals, restored mosaics, quarry steps, watermills, water‑raising towers.  
- Conservation status & current use of hydraulic installations (towers, aqueduct).  
- Detailed phasing (sequence & dates) of Primacy chapel rebuilds (5 phases summarized but not individually dated).  
- Legal protection / designation & management framework not stated.  
- Community / contemporary devotional practice details (frequency, rituals) absent.  
- Extent, dating, and integrity of anchorage(s) and potential connection to Bronze/Iron Age Kinneret unconfirmed.  
- Precise chronology of decline (Persian vs early Islamic impacts) insufficiently discriminated.  
- Condition & accessibility data for Beatitudes chapel remains (closed site) not detailed.  
- Quantitative data (dimensions) missing for some features (watermills, towers, grotto platform).  

0.2 Data Suggestions (targeted 2–4 improvements)  
1. Commission focused condition survey (photos + measured notes) for mosaics, quarry steps, hydraulic towers, watermills.  
2. Provide stratigraphic / phase table (Primacy chapel 5 phases + dates, sources) and separate Sermon location evidence comparison (chapel vs Eremos).  
3. Add harbor / anchor stones documentation (GPS, drawings, material, tentative dating, comparanda) or specialist assessment.  
4. Supply current governance: ownership parcels, legal designations, conservation policies, recent interventions (dates, methods).  

0.3 Gap List (items with “—” or partial evidence)  
- Harbor / anchorage dating & function.  
- Sermon on the Mount precise location evidence comparison.  
- Detailed phase-by-phase Primacy chapel chronology.  
- Current condition & authenticity notes (mosaic restoration extent, reconstructed capitals criteria, hydraulic structures).  
- Legal / protection status & management plan.  
- Intangible / living pilgrimage practices (ritual forms, seasonal peaks).  
- Dimensions & technical data (towers, mills, grotto terrace, aqueduct length).  
- Decline phase causation detail (Persian vs Arab impacts).  

0.4 Checklist (Baseline + Site-Specific Rows)  
| Category | Status | Note |  
|---|---|---|  
| Location & Setting | Good | NW shore Sea of Galilee; springs-fed fertile valley. |  
| Original Function & Dates | Partial | Fishing ground; early 4th‑c chapel (needs founding date precision). |  
| Evolution / Phases | Partial | Multi-phase (4th, 5th–6th apex, decline 7th+, revivals 19th–20th); some phases undated. |  
| Contexts (social, historical, etc.) | Partial | Pilgrimage, hydraulic-agricultural, fishing, monastic; community practice detail lacking. |  
| Physical Description | Good/Partial | Components listed; condition metrics & dimensions missing. |  
| Finds / Artefacts | Good/Partial | Mosaics, inscriptions, olive press, coin 108/109; harbor/anchors undated. |  
| Hydraulic & Agricultural Systems | Partial | Springs, aqueduct, towers, mills—condition & chronology gaps. |  
| Pilgrimage & Intangible Practice | Partial | Traditions cited; present rituals, user groups, seasonality absent. |  
| Maritime / Harbor Features | Weak | Anchorage & anchor stones noted; no dating study. |  

Timeline Rule (do not omit)  
Multiple dated / dateable phases present (4th‑c chapel; late 5th‑c basilica & mosaics; 7th‑c destruction; 1889–90 survey; 1911 excavation; 1932–36 excavations; 1964 papal visit; 1968–69 excavations; 1980 reconstruction; 2000 papal visit). Stage 1 MUST build a Timeline Table including every listed event. ⚠️ Timeline incomplete for: individual Primacy chapel rebuild phases; exact dates of hydraulic tower construction; harbor chronology.

Stop Questions  
1a. Would you like to add, correct, or change anything in this summary?  
2a. Do you approve moving to Stage 1?  

Workshop Challenge Questions  
1b. Which single undated element (harbor, anchor stones, Primacy rebuild phases, or hydraulic towers) would most strengthen the forthcoming Timeline if clarified first?  
2b. For the Sermon on the Mount location ambiguity (chapel vs Hillcrest of Eremos), do you have additional evidence (maps, photos, excavation notes) to prioritize one tradition?
